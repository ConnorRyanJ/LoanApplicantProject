# LoanApplicantProject

This project compares multiple different maching learning classification models to to determine if a loan applicant should be approved for a loan or not. 

The data was pulled from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan?select=Loan_Data.csv)

This project was intended to provide me with practice in data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification modeling techniques.

Libraries used include: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and SKLearn

In the future, as I learn more about the advancements in machine learning, I hope to use this project as practice in improving and evaluating classification models.
